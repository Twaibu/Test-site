    he gave him all he needed for living happy and everlasting
    life  on small garden called "Eden" . However, God gave him
    a special commandment of not to feed from one of tree shown
    to him but in contrast to that he could feed from other re
    mained. </p>
  
    <p>No soon had God give him such commandment than he refused
    to obey , but as the God had told , he started to face his 
    impacts of not obeying this lovely commandment.But, becouse
    Jehovah is love, he prepared a way of giving opportunity 
    to the offsprings of Adam but for the condition for
    believing his only begotton son who died on their
    behalf so as to possess earthly paradise.The condition for
    a person to be considered loyal to God he should exercises 
    knowing </p>

    <li> Jehovah the only true God.</li>
    <li> Jesus his only begotten son .</li>
